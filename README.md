<u>The following repository highlights some data analysis work I completed on behalf of Pinewood School in Summer 2024.</u> For each of the projects listed below, I would generate the relevant query in Veracross before importing the raw *CSV* files from these queries into a Jupyter Notebook (see **Alumni_Projects.ipynb**), conducting some necessary post-processing and clean-up which wasn't simple and/or possible to accomplish in Veracross. Using these cleaned-up queries, I would then complete the task on hand (e.g., identify 5 individuals I would recommend for a future alumni panel), sending over the exported Excel spreadsheet as well as any relevant materials over to my superiors. 

<u>For confidentiality reasons, this notebook uses entirely randomized data</u> (generated via the **Random_Data_Generator** Python script also attached in this GitHub repository); since the randomly-generated data is largely tailored to what was present in the actual data, though, the query post-processing procedures shown here are also what was undertaken on the actual data.

<u>A description of each of the projects highlighted in **Alumni_Projects.ipynb** is attached below:</u>

1. **Project 1:** Pull a list for College Counseling
    * Need a report of any college-age alum (graduated past 4 years)
    * Please include their name, name of their university, field of study, and email address
    * Bonus: If you could pull any post-graduate folks still currently in school (Masters, PhD, etc.) with their name, name of their university, field of study, and email address, that’d be great
    * Please sort this by graduation year, take out any unnecessary fields, and clean up the headers
2. **Project 2:** You’ve spent so much time working with the alumni data - I’m curious who you’ve come across that has piqued your interest in a few different categories.
   * Objectively very successful or semi-famous
   * Anyone you’ve come across and thought, wow they’re cool. I’d love to hear them speak/be their friend/get a coffee with them.
   * Is interesting, and doesn’t necessarily fit neatly into the traditional career categories.
3. **Project 3:** At some point in the future, I could see us trying to bring in local alumni to speak about their professional experiences/career track with current students. Please suggest 3 possible candidates for each category (if applicable), keeping in mind diversity of the candidate pool, and provide their name, graduation year, and a short bio. This could include alumni in their 3rd year of university or older.
   * Creative/the arts
   * Tech
   * Medicine/healthcare
   * Nonprofit/social sector
   * Business/finance
   * Government/public administration
   * Law
   * Sustainability
4. **Project 4:** At some point in the future, I could see us trying to do an interdisciplinary case competition that encourages students to propose a solution to a given real-world social challenge. Recommend 6-8 possible candidates for judges, that ideally:
   * Have at least 5 years of post-grad experience
   * Comprise multiple backgrounds (ex: tech, nonprofit, medicine, etc.)
   * Are local to the Bay Area
   * Factor in diversity of the panel (ex: age, gender, race)
   * Bonus: they have some kind of social entrepreneurship background (ex: Scott Edwards at Drop Water)

As a final note, the other *CSV* files attached in this repository are used in the **Random_Data_Generator** Python script, but are otherwise useless.
